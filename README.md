This project's assignment is to re-create the design below as close as possible.

# Project Outcome

To not get overwhelmed by all the whats and hows, I created the website section by section solving one problem at a time.

Throughout the development process I made sure to
- avoid catching Divitis (overusing divs) 
- stick to using semantic HTML elements to make the code cleaner and more readable
- keep my CSS DRY
